The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100.
Traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI are that values of 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming overbought or overvalued and may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. An RSI reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold or undervalued condition.

The rsi evaluates the gain over the loss in the last periods, and higher the gains, higher the rsi. So in a bullish market when in there are more gains in tha last periods the rsi will have highervalues.

### Trading

When the rsi is above 50 indicates a bullish trend.
When bellow 50 indicates a bearish trend.

When the rsi is bellow 30 that is an opportunity to buy. Try to buy when it is bellow 30 and rises above the previous day high.
