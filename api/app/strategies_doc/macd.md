### Description

MACD stands for moving avarage convergence divergence
It uses moving avarages as its imputs.
Momentum indicator
Turns two trend-following indicators, moving avarages, into a momentum oscilator, by subtracting a longer exponential moving avarage from a shorter one.
Consists of three components, namely two lines and a histogram.
The MACD line is the faster line on the indicator. (React faster to price changes).
MACD signal line, is slower and is frequently breached by the faster MACD line.
MACD histogram, represents the difference the MACD line and the signal line. The bigger the gaps, the higher the bars.

### Trading

The most important aspect is the interaction between the two lines, as well as their positions relative to the zero line.
When the MACD line is above the zero line, it indicates that the shorter-period moving avarage is above the longer period moving avarage, which in turn indicates that the market is bullish. (Strategy 1)
When the MACD line falls bellow the zero line, the shorter period moving avarage is less than the longer one, indicating that demand is more bearish than it was in the past.

If the fast MACD line is above the slower one(signal line), suggest a bullish bias.
If the MACD is bellow the signal, indicates a bearish momentum.

### Strategies

- Crossover
  A buy signal is generated when the MACD crosses above the signal line.
  A sell signal is generated when the MACD crosses bellow the signal line.
  In addition, the locations of these crossovers in relation to the zero line are helpful in determining buy and sell points.
  Bullish signals are more significant when the crossing of the MACD over the signal, takes place bellow the zero line.
  Confirmation takes place when both cross above the zero line.

Using it this way, makes it a lagging indicator, just like moving avarages, works best in strong trending markets.

\*\*\* Use it as a buffer to reduce risk, not as the main signal.

- Overbought / Oversold
  An overbought condition may exist when the price has experienced a significant upward move.
  At some point you expect that the price might fall and return to some more "normal" level.
  Likewise when the price has seem an extended downward movement, an oversold condition may exist.
  At some point the price may be expected to rise to some normal level.
  It may be overbough when you see the MACD rise significantly.
  During this period, the shorter moving avarage used in the MACD calculation is rising faster than the longer one. This is and indication that the price is overextending itself and, at some point, may reverse.

  So, the best buy signals, are bellow the zero line, when the MACD cross the signal line, when there is an oversold condition.
  There is no predetermined overbought or oversold condition (See rsi), you may need to study the behaviour over time to decide when is overbought or oversold.

- Divergence
  A divergence occurs when the trend of the price does not agree with that of the indicator. In other words, an indicator trends in one direction while the price goes in the other.
  Tend to indicate a reversal in the current price trend.
  A bullish divergence forms when the price records a lower low, and the MACD a higher low. The lower low in the price affirms the current downtrend, but the higher low in the MACD shows less downside momentum.
  A bullish divergence takes place when the MACD is making new highs even though the prices fail to reach new highs. Greater importance should be placed if the price makes a new relative low while this pattern develops.
  Furthermore, both signals carry greater significance if they occur at relative overbought or oversold levels.

You can use the histogram to search for divergences, but also the MACD and the signal line. The strongest signal appear when there is a double divergence, on both the histogram and the MACD and signal line.

Tip: Track the behaviour of the MACD on a daily chart, and confirm the trade with the weekly frame.
